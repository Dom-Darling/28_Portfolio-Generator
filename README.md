Description
The Portfolio Generator is a command-line tool designed to help users create and manage their online portfolios. It is built using Node.js and the Inquirer package for interactive user interfaces. The generator allows users to input their personal and professional information, such as name, title, contact details, and a list of projects. The generated README file is then populated with this information, along with Markdown-formatted content for project descriptions, installation instructions, usage examples, contributing guidelines, and testing instructions.
